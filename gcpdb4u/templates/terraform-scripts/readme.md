# Terraform examples

### Google Terraform Provider Auth Config
- Create a Google Service Account
- Assign project Owner role (service and shared vpc project's)
- run the following commands on your terminal
```
gcloud config set auth/impersonate_service_account <GSA-NAME>@<PROJECT>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
export GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-access-token)
```
- In order to create a Databricks workspace the required roles are explained over [here](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/gcp/customer-managed-vpc.html#role-requirements). As the GSA could provision additional resource's beyond Databricks workspace ex private DNS zone, A records, PSC endpoints etc, it is better to have Owner role to avoid any permission related issues.

- If you are using service account impersonation then please follow this [run book](../terraform-scripts/sa-impersonation.md)
