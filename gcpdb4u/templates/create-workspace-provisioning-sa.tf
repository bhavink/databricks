/**
You have a choice to either create a custom role with required permissions to create databricks workspace or
use builtin roles. We'll leave it upto the end user preference on what to use.

Please make sure to carefully go thru the script before running it.

If you are using custom role then you do not need to use builtin-roles block
Please comment it out.

Databricks accounts console is available at: https://accounts.gcp.databricks.com
SA created needs to be added to the accounts console as a "User" (https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-settings-gcp/admin-users.html) 
and need to have admin role assigned (https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/administration-guide/users-groups/users.html#account-admin)
