## Use Identity Federation
- Utilize **Google Cloud Identity** or **SCIM provisioning** to centrally manage users.
- Enable **single sign-on (SSO)** for streamlined authentication.
- Reference: [Databricks Identity Federation](https://docs.databricks.com/gcp/en/admin/users-groups/scim.html).

## Follow Least Privilege Access
- Assign only necessary permissions to users to limit security risks.
- Use predefined **Databricks workspace permissions** (e.g., Admin, User, Viewer).
- Regularly review and remove excessive permissions.

## Use Groups for Role-Based Access Control
- Create **groups** in Databricks and assign permissions at the group level rather than individual users.
- Align groups with **project teams** or **functional roles**.
- Assign workspace and cluster access based on the principle of least privilege.

## Manage Service Principals for Automation
- Use **service principals** instead of personal accounts for automated jobs and API access.
- Assign appropriate permissions to service principals without unnecessary admin rights.
- Reference: [Manage Service Principals](https://docs.databricks.com/gcp/en/admin/users-groups/service-principals.html).

## Audit and Monitor Access
- Regularly check **audit logs** to monitor access patterns and potential security risks.
- Use **Databricks system tables** to track user activity.
- Reference: [Audit Logging](https://docs.databricks.com/gcp/en/admin/account-settings/audit-logs.html).

## Review and Revoke Unused Access
- Periodically review user access and **disable inactive users**.
- Revoke access from employees who leave or change roles.
- Use automated scripts to enforce access reviews.
