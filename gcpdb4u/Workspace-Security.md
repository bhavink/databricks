# Objectives
Databricks provides two flavors of compute
- Clasic compute
- Serverless compute

* Each workspace is provisioned within the customer's GCP project. [Classic compute](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/clusters/index.html) resides within customers project and utlizes customers vpc.
* Life cycle of a databricks cluster (classic or serverless) is managed by Databricks Control Plane.
* Compute instance type aka `node's` used by a Databricks cluster is backed by GCE instances aka nodes
* Nodes have Private IP addresses only (classic and serverless compute)
  
* To provide a secure logical isolation between databricks clusters within same workspace (classic or serverless) Databricks implements logical namespaceâ€™s i.e no two clusters can talk to each other directly, communication is always managed thru databricks control plane.

## Optionally
* Configure [VPC Service Control](./security/Configure-VPC-SC.md) to prevent data exfiltration
* Lock down [VPC firewall rules](./security/LockDown-VPC-Firewall-Rules.md)
