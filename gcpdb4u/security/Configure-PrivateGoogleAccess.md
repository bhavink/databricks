# What is it?

Private Google Access can be enabled on a subnet by subnet basis and all it really means is that VM instances will communicate with Google APIs via their internal IP addresses rather than using external IPs to communicate via the internet. The diagram below shows how this works:

By default, when a Compute Engine VM, in our case Databricks cluster nodes lacks an external IP (public ip) address assigned to its network interface, it can only send packets to other internal IP address destinations. You can allow these VMs to connect to the set of external IP addresses used by Google APIs and services by enabling Private Google Access (PGA) on the subnet used by the VM's network interface.

When Private Google Access is enabled the communication from Databricks clusters running within your Project using your VPC (dataplane) to Databricks control plane services like artifact repo(Databricks runtime images) and Google cloud storage account(workspace health check logs and usage logs) stays private, using Private Google Access [PGA] we can ensure that communication between data plane and these services stays over Googleâ€™s internal network.

## `How to do it?`
### `High Level Steps`
1. VPC and subnets used by Databricks have private Google access(PGA) enabled
2. Configure DNS, VPC firewall rule and VPC routes as explained over [here](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access)
  - It is extremely important that you configure PGA as explained on the GCP public doc site.
  - If you are using VPC SC then both, the private.googleapis.com as well as restricted.googleapis.com DNS records along with routes and firewall rules are required.
3. Configure DNS private zone for *.pkg.dev (repo from where databricks runtime is downloaded) as explained over [here](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access). 

## Differences between `private.googleapis.com` and `restricted.googleapis.com`

### Overview
The primary difference between `private.googleapis.com` and `restricted.googleapis.com` lies in their use cases and the network configurations they require. Here is an overview of each:

### `private.googleapis.com`
1. **Use Case**: `private.googleapis.com` is designed for users who want to access Google APIs and services from within a private network, such as a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in Google Cloud. It provides a secure way to access these services without traversing the public internet.
2. **Configuration**: This endpoint requires setting up Private Google Access within a VPC. This allows resources within the VPC to access Google APIs and services using internal IP addresses, enhancing security by avoiding exposure to the public internet.
3. **Access**: It restricts access to Google APIs to only those resources that are within the VPC, ensuring a more secure connection.
4. **DNS Resolution**: When using `private.googleapis.com`, DNS resolution for Google API domains resolves to private IP addresses that are accessible only within the VPC.

### `restricted.googleapis.com`
1. **Use Case**: `restricted.googleapis.com` is intended for environments that need to adhere to stricter egress control and security policies, often required for regulated industries. It provides an additional layer of security by limiting access to a restricted set of Google services and APIs.
2. **Configuration**: This endpoint requires setting up VPC Service Controls, which provide security perimeters around Google Cloud resources to prevent data exfiltration. This is suitable for organizations needing to meet regulatory and compliance requirements.
3. **Access**: It restricts access to a more limited set of Google APIs and services compared to `private.googleapis.com`. This endpoint helps to enforce security policies and compliance requirements by allowing only specific Google services.
4. **DNS Resolution**: Similar to `private.googleapis.com`, DNS resolution for `restricted.googleapis.com` resolves to private IP addresses within the VPC. However, the scope of accessible services is more limited.

### Key Differences
1. **Scope of Access**:
   - `private.googleapis.com` provides broader access to Google APIs and services within a VPC.
   - `restricted.googleapis.com` limits access to a narrower set of Google services, aligning with stricter security and compliance requirements.
2. **Security and Compliance**:
   - `private.googleapis.com` focuses on providing secure access within a VPC.
   - `restricted.googleapis.com` enhances security by enforcing more stringent access controls and is often used in regulated environments.
3. **Configuration Requirements**:
   - Both require Private Google Access and appropriate DNS setup within a VPC.
   - `restricted.googleapis.com` additionally requires VPC Service Controls for creating security perimeters.

In summary, `private.googleapis.com` is suitable for general secure access to Google services within a private network, while `restricted.googleapis.com` is designed for environments needing enhanced security and compliance controls.
